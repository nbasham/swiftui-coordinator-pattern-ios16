# swiftui-coordinator-pattern-ios16

The purpose of this repo is to explore how the Coordinator Pattern might be used with iOS 16+. This is a nonsense app that explores the use of a `NavigationStack` using a `NavigationPath`. All advice, suggestions, and contributions welcome. One known issue is that after pussing the second screen (Settings) and choosing the menu (About) an error shows in the console:

```PresentationHostingController from detached view controller is discouraged.```

Can anyone explain why?
